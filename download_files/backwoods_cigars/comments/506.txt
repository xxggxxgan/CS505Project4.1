Who in charge of your product quality cause it’s trash whoever in charge of what is going out should be fired 5 packs with holes in every blunt. Someone should be fired and hire someone who actually know what quality is to control it. Smh

Those not vanillas tho
Backwoods lovers. Just a public service announcement. If you want better consistency, check out #frontwoods cigars. If you ask anyone I am the first person to have always sworn by backwoods. But over the past 2 years backwoods have gone so much downhill. Every pack now a days has either dry cigars, thin cigars or they are just covered with holes and rips. The consistency in backwoods has come to the point where you drop 14-16$ now a pack and only get like 2 good blunts. Frontwoods are ALWAYS on point. And you can still find them at 7$ a pack. All same flavours you love from backwoods. But it a better smoke.
We want backwoods in souf Africa y u tripping
