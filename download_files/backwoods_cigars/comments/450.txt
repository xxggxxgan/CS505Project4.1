Ainâ€™t no time for me bruh I take my dam time to roll up that fat backwood if you rushing me just know you ainâ€™t hitting the perfection when Iâ€™m done ðŸ’¯
Rolling is therapeutic for me. Donâ€™t rush the process.
The better question is how many times do you have to reseal it ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
ðŸ’žðŸ’žðŸ’žðŸ’žðŸ’žðŸ’ž
Two seconds
If the bud is broken up, yaâ€™ll should NOT be taking more then a solid 2 mins
3 mins tops!
