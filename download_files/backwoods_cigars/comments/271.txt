Backwoods, so the whole quarantine been real. It’s been crazy. Bruh, I can’t give you the exact numbers but out of alllll the 5 packs I buy from y’all man, I’m getting 2 maybe 3 good woods out the pack. Very slim chance I get 5 for 5. I just bust down a pack and and had to trash all 5 of em. Then them hoes priced different everywhere. Anyways, Fam, look 👏🏽. Can we please get this together. At very least till we moving normally again. Thanks..btw they are never stale. Just too much glue or whatever that stuff is and big ass vines. Thanks 🙂
