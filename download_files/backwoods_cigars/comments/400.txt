Backwoods be stale ashit nowadays 🤦🏾\u200d♂️ shit be pissin me off

I love backwoods but buying them is a gamble most of the time they are dry and so light colored to the point where it’s see through and can give you headaches when smoking. Good backwoods are dark and burn slow and they are too expensive to buy so they just stay on the shelf getting dryer each minute
Fuck backwoods
