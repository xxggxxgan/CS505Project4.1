Shit boatin crazy 😂
I smoke backwoods and only backwards for about two years now and even though people hassle me all the time for it I promise to stay faithful because it gives me that good vibe that I’m always looking for. Keep up the great work try to bring back some of them crazy flavors for us 😂👍 And hopefully one day I can post a pic good enough to be on your site 💯💯🙏👍
