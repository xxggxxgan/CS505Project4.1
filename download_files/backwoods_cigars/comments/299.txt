Facts
Why are backwoods so much shittier now then they were even last year? 3/5 in a pack have a fucking stem running through the whole leaf or have a shit ton of tears/holes in them... get it together smh
@jackhoward.1 they went to shit I find a better smoke in game leaves at half the price
@fatboyju might as well buy games or fronto at this point smh
@jackhoward.1 facts only thing I don’t like about fronto/grabba is it doesn’t seem to stick well for some reason but other then that it’s good. It’s just sad cuz backwoods are the most hyped leaves out here but pretty much any other leaves I’ve bought have been better quality and at a better price. Even them cheap ass “sweet woods” 2 for a dollar and imo better then backwoods. I usually go with 1882’s or game leaves and rarely have problems except for the game leaves coming with the occasional hole or huge stem. The 1882’s are usually perfect might have one in a pack with a big ass stem or sum but very rarely any holes or cracks
Damn backwoods cost too much to have 3 bad in a 5 pack. Fuck is up with that. Can we get some consistency in the quality of these shits
