Whatchu think of my rolls??
Been smoking backwoods for awhile now and love them don’t get me wrong that why I keep hoping they will get better again. Just wondering why the quality has gone to shit, yes I know they have always had stems in the leafs but ussually you can flatten them out the last like 5-6 packs I have bought there has been 1-2 decent leafs and the wrest are junk usually full of huge stems that you can’t even roll, and random holes all over, not to mention I bought a pack last week and they had mold on them. Called them they said they would make it up to me, asked me if I saved it, why would I keep a moldy back wood around?? I took pictures... but threw it right out. Then today I get in the mail a coupon if I buy a pack i can get a pack free and it doesn’t even give me the option of Russian cream. What happened to the free ones i was suppose to get @backwoods_cigars? Looks like I’ll have to try out some new sort of wrap for now till your start making quality product again, and why don’t we sell the domestics in the US? Those vanilla and grapes would sell like crazy
Ur shells suck there absolute ass
