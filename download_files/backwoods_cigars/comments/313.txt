@backwoods_cigars the most inconsistent cigar yet..almost impossible to consistently get a fresh pack...and usually only 3 out of 5 are good...good thing you put nicotine in the tobacco or no one would consistently blow money on these 🙄. I’ve wasted hundreds on stale packs, leaves that are falling apart etc....
@truuusg when I say hundreds I mean thousands
Every backwoods pack in Canada is trash 🙄

Can we get zippers on the 3 pack?
