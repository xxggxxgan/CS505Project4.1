Hey guys I been smoking backwood products since age 13 I’m now 28. You know well as I do the product is far from what it once was. Every time I purchase its a gamble on if I’ll get a dark sweet wood with no holes and what I remember the product being when first started to trust the brand for the best quality cigars on the market. The backwood company at one point was in a class of their own with competition non existing. As a unhappy but loyal customer please make the necessary changes to once again be a one of a kind cigar brand and company. @backwoods_cigars
Can you please stop fucking around and bring new flavors out to major cities. I’m tired of smoking these weak ass berrys and creams and fuckin bourbon. We need vanillas, grape , bananas fuckin wild rum cmon y’all!!
Yall need expiration dates on the packs 💯
