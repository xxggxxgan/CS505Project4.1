Y’all fucking suck now
Your product in canada is trash
You dont respond to complaints on the phone line, or dms. Seriously garbage every single pack from canada in the last year or two. I just went through 2 cartons and threw out probably 60 to 70% of the cigars. Stale and broken. Why are the american ones always a better quality leaf? Very disappointing
I mentioned y’all on my banger song y’all should sponsor me no 🧢
