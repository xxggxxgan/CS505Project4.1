What’s with your new packs going out into the world how am I supposed to smoke a whole stale pack... Everytime I open a pack it’s three good cigars in it. Yesterday I opened one and all of the pack was stale I literally pressed it and it all crumbled it’s bullshit 10$ a pack to not be able to smoke tf
Mines as well switch back to dutchies or papers with fronto cause backwoods are not it anymore
