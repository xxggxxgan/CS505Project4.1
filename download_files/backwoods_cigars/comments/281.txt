I recently purchased two packs of original (5 in a pack) and two Russian cream singles to try out....that’s 12 cigars out of 12. Four were smoke able six had holes and two broken..... @backwoods_cigars that is horrible horrible QA/QC work. I’m just going to use @rawlife247 at this point. I also emailed customer service twice to no avail!
@watchronthewall check dms
All heaters 🔥 @backwoods_cigars

My personal opinion.... Russian Creams All Day But Black Russians My Alternative But Great Work 👌🏼🙌🏽💯
Half of those are stale got holes in ... swisher leaf is on the come up 😔😔
probably gonna end up throwing out 300 of em because they have stems and are stale
me
Russian Cream🎯🎯🎯
If it ain’t a “BACKWOOD” then it ain’t all that GOOD
Stores around me never have fresh woods or look at me crazy for asking for them 😂😂
I’ll roll each and everyone of them woods with no problem
Fakes🤬🤬🤬
STAY HIGH 💚
