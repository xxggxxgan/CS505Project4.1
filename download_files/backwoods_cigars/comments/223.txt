Massachusetts banned all flavoured tobacco products, now I cant get my honey berry backwoods cause they are illegal,but I can get my weed ... how crazy is that?!
@mentaloriental_ack was about to comment that. Shits fucked in MA right now no woods anywhere
@rollgamereal shit is so wrong bro, like banning flavoured products is going to curb the vaping problem behind this ban...nice #Massachusetts way to fight the good fight👎🏽
Bring the 8 packs back out
