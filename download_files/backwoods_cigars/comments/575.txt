@backwoods_cigars For somebody thatâ€™s been smoking these cigars since the 90s, Iâ€™m actually disappointed in what you have become as a brand. You guys give absolutely zero credit to the people who truly support your brand and yet you acknowledge a bunch of fake fucking lameâ€™s who only smoke backwoods because of the popularity they have recently gained
Mac Dre was rapping about backwoods in the 90s and early 2000â€™s, not one single rapper from todayâ€™s era deserves any credit or recognition for smoking backwoods
