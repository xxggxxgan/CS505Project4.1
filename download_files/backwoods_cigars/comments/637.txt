You guys are whack for only selling these to certain people/countries so you can inflate the market value
@thraxsupply lool ur stupid that would actually be a terrible marketing strategy. The real reason they don’t sell grape, banana, vanilla etc. in the US\\Canada is because the government had said those kinds of flavours would be much more appealing to kids
@nicfrmtdottt there are no laws against selling grape flavored cigars and or cigarillos in America. Swisher sells grape cigars. Garcia Vega sells grape shells under the name Game leafs. Optimal sells grape cigarillos. Good Times sells grape flavored shells
@thraxsupply dude deadass just search it up
