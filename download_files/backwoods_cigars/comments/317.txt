Boom, It’s 2017 And I’m Already Fuckin Wit Dutches So I Try Something Different. I Buy A Single Wood For 1.50 And Did My Research, Rolled A 2.5 That Day And Damn Near Murdered Myself. I Took 2 Dutches Wit A Gram Each In Them To Calm My Lungs Down And Kept Fw Backwoods As Long As They Were Honey Bourbon @ The Time. Now That’s A Daily Thing Fa Me 🌴🤟🏽
I split it🤦🏾\u200d♂️.
When I was 19 y/o I bought my first legal pack of @backwoods_cigars & I ain’t kno how to roll it at first then me n the homie watched a yt video on how to roll em now I’m the mf goat at rolling woods 🤣😎🔥
With my old friend, we smoked one in front of my house in 2016 It took me like 30 mins to figure out what the fuck I was doing
Real kush in a raw can smoke like a backwood ting
