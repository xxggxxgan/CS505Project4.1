Just some advice y’all need to bring y’all focus back on the quality of the backwood I’m tired of buying a 5pack and it’s one moldy one and one crusty one 😂
@manthacakestv @brothersbroadleaf is the way. Thank me later.
But still never will smoke a rello ong 🔥
Only roll woods if you have the zaza on deck otherwise get fiesta wraps or blue dream fusion dutches. No rolling woods with mids or lower!
What about duchies ? Basically like a backwood and a swisher had a kid lol 💯💨💨💨
@youngdevil805 only the cigars though
On gaWd!
I’m sick of backwood OHKSY .. all the 5 packs I buy a week is ridiculous.

I throw my light skin backwoods at rello smokers
Raws are better then woods 😂 I like woods but there def not the best. I think that title belongs to raw for sure.
