Reminiscing back to 4 years ago when the Artist Project was just getting started. We connected with Ponce in LA for one of the first C-Store Sessions. In that same year, we linked up with Kelechi to perform at our first ever Atlanta Pack Night. Now theyâ€™re stealing the red carpet together! Show our fam some love, follow @ponce_tv + @kelechief and check out their music.
