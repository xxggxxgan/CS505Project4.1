Every year, we select one artist who has shown that they are committed to helping the next crop of young artists get to the top. We honor this artist with the #SwisherSweets Spark Award, a symbol that they are committed to providing a spark for the next generation. Not only do we give them the Spark Award, we throw them an exclusive party out in Beverly Hills and invite our favorite emerging talent to see greatness firsthand. This year we were proud to present the 2018 Spark Award to @laflare1017 at The London in West Hollywood.
