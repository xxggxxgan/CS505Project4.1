Getting to the top is never easy. 
We founded the #SwisherArtistProject as a way to give back to the culture thatâ€™s repped the #SwisherSweets shield since day one. The Artist Project is an accelerator for the next generation of rap and hip hop visionaries. We pair them with other artists at the top of their game, give them a chance to show out in front of their home crowd, then invite the best to join us in making their mark.

The best part of it, fam? Youâ€™re along for the ride. Keep an eye on ap.swishersweets.com for the #PackNight2018 tour schedule. Youâ€™ll get to see the best emerging talent in your city, catch an unforgettable set by one of our headliners, then vote to send your favorite local artist on to our end of the year bash.

Get ready, Swisher fam. 2018 is going to be ðŸ”¥
