I spend over 300$$ a year on these wraps and I can’t get an invite 🙄😑😪
@trxppyjigg 😂😂
Damn I love swishes but now idk if I can smoke them. Too afraid of getting drugged and robbed.
I may never buy these again.
I WILL NOT BE GETTING @swishersweets ANYMORE FELLAS COVER YOUR DRINKS 🤦\u200d♂️
you already know why she be supporting them
Swisher sweets, I’m sorry imma have to bring the heat. Cause y’all don’t smoke right, rolled and stuffed just too tight. If you try to smoke one with us we will fight. So I’m sorry, but I only smoke natural leafs, not whatever y’all be trying to serve to me. Y’all be up in gas stations with all type of flavors. But it don’t matter cause they’ll still be there later. Cause no one buys them. Especially not me, so how about you switch over to #82gang and smoke leaves\n#bars #82gang

Should call this Project Steal Your Shit
They really love praising her. Come smoke 1882’s where we got our morals straight🍁🍁🍁🍁🍁
@garcia_y_vega_1882s nah. no point in arguing with a fan page faked labeled "official". Trying to gain clout and followers by bashing a competing brands page. Pathetic. Swedish is a professional company. They dont do that. Fan boy. Ghost.
Such a damn boss 🥳🥳
