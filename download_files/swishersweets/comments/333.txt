@djstoneywinter This cigar was brought out as one of our Limited Edition cigarillos. It is the intent of our Marketing Department to introduce new flavors periodically throughout the year to see how much our consumers like them. I do not know if this particular cigar will make it to our permanent line up of tastes.
It’s hard to find this Arctic 🥶 ice 🧊
Please bring these back☹️
