Just tried that flavor yesterday. It was cool.
@ttuna1985 what does it taste like?
@sam_da_jew honestly it reminded me of lemonade.
Best wrap of all time 💯💯💯💯
Yassss! Love This Swisher!!! 😍😍😍😍
@swishersweets I’ve been smoking these since I was 16. I’m 29 now. When should I expect to “get” cancer or heart disease? Lol. I guess I’ll sue if I do. Just read the back of the pack.
Why it look like she ate the first wrap
