How come I never see anybody smoke a swisher by itself everyone takes out the insides and puts marijuana in them why do t they just come w marijuana in them
@rohnwick if you smoke the thing that’s inside, what if you do not take it off and replace it with weed but just smoke it like that, is it bad for you?
@homersimpggg weed isn’t harmful as tobacco but u still take carcinogen in ure lungs both ways
@rohnwick well yea
