MGK dies in Bird box
mgk just looking for work wherever he can huh? eminem ended his music career so hes turned to acting and anything else he can. respect for still trying brotha
@lovilov21 sad life you live huh. no followers, no friends, no life, and thinks mgk is some sort or hierarchy. i hope one day you get the love you need in life, but it’s doubtful if you keep being this annoying. you realize bye Felicia* is the oldest meme in like actual history right. yes please leave me alone ive had more intelligent conversations with seals at the zoo
