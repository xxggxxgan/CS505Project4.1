FUCK A BACKWOODS, SWISHER WHAT I USE BOY
What time is he performing??
His fine ass
You mean high capacity magazine, rapid fire, assault weapon Kelly?
How does anyone listen to his music 😂 he is a rapper for people who just started listening to rap that’s its , at age 16 I thought he was a joke 😂 by 18 I couldn’t understand how he has 10 supporters . The world we live in is so confusing . You have to have a low iq to tolerate his childish rhymes
@its420letssmoke "hes got stories for days man you just gotta listen" cool @ name though 😂😂
@its420letssmoke you’ve obviously never listened to anything other than his radio shit.. go listen to Spotlight or A Little More or See My Tears or Habits...just to name a few
@its420letssmoke You’d be surprised who his millions of supporters are and why. Can’t box him into any ONE thing.. rapper, rocker, actor, model, entertainer, artist, etc. I get it though, he’s not for everybody and this is merely your opinion. Easy to dislike something you can’t comprehend. Btw.. I’m 50 and my musical palette has stretched from coast to coast for decades in all genres. @machinegunkelly is on a wave. Hope you know how to swim.😉
