I love these i smoke them right out the packðŸ˜‚
Already got me a packðŸ˜‚ðŸ™Œ
Any chance we might be able to start redeeming/recycling these nifty little foil packs for shirts, or stickers, pin or whatnot??? Sure do find a lot of them laying around, know i got at least 70 or 80 laying around...
@fgallardoii1982 Just dont be poor and buy your own shit
Im Sure we could even figure a way to write some of the stuff off as tax deductible... Wink wink
It was more of a recycling issue, but "the best thing you can do for poor people is not be one of them..."
We need to colab @swishersweets
You better fuck with me before the price goes up ðŸ˜œðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨
Loved them
