Ain’t it crazy you can put in plain sight that something is cancer causing and addictive, yet so many people will consume it anyway 😳
@slime4l1ef so why would you wrap in it something that causes cancer?
@slime4l1ef would you cook steak in the freezer?
@jonahdills that what I’m saying 😂I smoke raw anyways
Release sum in Indonesia bruh
Side note: dude got some dirt on the ice in that cup 😂
One of our favorite cigarillos 🔥
Grape nasty ash 🤢
@swishersweets So y’all really think they smoking tobacco at that party?😂😂
@fxrahyt the entire wrap is tobacco dogg. It’s made of tobacco 🤦\u200d♂️
@rarebreed420 nigga just shut up 🤦🏾\u200d♂️
It’s why we put weed in them
Grape 🍇 is the BEST!! And purple swish still lookin for that dulce de leche
