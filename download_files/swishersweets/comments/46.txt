@j3moxx We’re doing everything we can to maintain the production and distribution of our cigars during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, some products are experiencing temporary delays\nbeyond our control. Our top priority is to ensure the safe return of our entire product family to a\nstore near you. We appreciate your continued patience and support as we work through these\nunfortunate circumstances.
My favorites are the caramel 🍑 ones! 🤤🤤🤤
