Cardi b is not for me
If you wanna rob multibillion dollar companies to make your rise to fame because they fuck someone over, be my guest. But drugging someone and robbing them is not in my book, a way to get famous at all. She stripped and stole her way to the top. She didnt put out any actual musical talent until money moves came out, which was sub par at best. Why anyone supports her, i have no fucking clue. But hey. She made it out the bronx and struggled like snoop and other rappers right?
@evo_official223 yeh but she got no talent or sense of self respect so whatever
@therealbennyquin i mean, ill let her have her music fans. She released music and people like it. I dont fucking know why, but i wont hate on her for that. She has no talent and robbed people to get where shes at. The only other people i know that can get rich off of robbing people and get away with it, are politicians.
U support this chick this y I dont smoke swishers no mo
