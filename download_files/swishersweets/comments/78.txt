@zaccaaryy__ Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our production of select Swisher Sweets items has been delayed. Please understand it is Swisher’s highest priority to return to normal production levels safely and to get all of our cigars back in distribution as soon as possible. We appreciate your continued support and patience through this difficult time 😎
@swishersweets good to hear back. Have my bong on go until swishers are back 😁👍🏽
