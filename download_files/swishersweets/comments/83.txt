Is it true that you guys stop making diamond Swisher @swishersweets
@jassibabi_330 Hi There, Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our production of select Swisher Sweets items has been delayed. Please understand it is Swisherâ€™s highest priority to return to normal production levels safely and to get all of our cigars back in distribution as soon as possible. We appreciate your continued support and patience through this difficult time ðŸ˜Ž
