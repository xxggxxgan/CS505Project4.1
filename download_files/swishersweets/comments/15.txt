What’s up how can we collaborate, how can I get swisher to sponsor an artist??
@therealcanseco Thank you for your interest in the Artist Project. Please contact info@artistproject.com with social media handles, and provide a detailed overview of your partnership request.
@swishersweets I have already emailed them, quite some time ago, and have been waiting quite some time for a response back. But thank you! I will try and send another email!! 🙏🙏💯
@therealcanseco Please do😉
Like fr what up with half of Texas being out of swishers
@dgaf.chewy We’re just as bummed about the shortage as you! Due to the pandemic, select items have been delayed in production. Thanks for being part of the Swisher Sweets family & know that were working hard to get things back to normal!
@swishersweets we gotta stay supportive of our favorite brands through this I’ll stay supporting you guys.
@dgaf.chewy We appreciate the love😎
Texas Forreals tho! Got stores over charging for 1 pack regular swisher sweets!
@jessss_gz We would like to pass this info along to our team. Can you please PM us with the details of the store?
@swishersweets yes I sure will!
