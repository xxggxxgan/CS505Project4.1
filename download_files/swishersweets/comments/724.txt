Do you guys ship stuff like this? I don’t have a 7-Eleven close I’d love to try all your wacky brands! Pm me

Technically aren’t these the Island Madness? They we’re both watermelon 🍉 rum
Wish these actually smelled like Watermelon tho.. They smell more like Cinnimon Cookies from Christmas.. Cant have watetmelon with no watermelon smell or flavor.
