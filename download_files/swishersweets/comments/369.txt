Where do we get them tho
@benjichasin18 store lol
Do they split is what were askin
@davidthegoblin he cappin, people like to ride trends and don’t even know backwoods been out forever no they charge these ducks more because they are popular. They are actually better than woods. With woods you never know if you going to get  bad one (stale and big ass stems.) @swishersweets leafs doesn’t have those thick ass stems and every pack bought all three have been fresh. Try it you have nothing to lose. Either pay 1.50 for one backwood and risk the change of it being bad or pay 1.49  for the swisher leafs and get three in a pack.
