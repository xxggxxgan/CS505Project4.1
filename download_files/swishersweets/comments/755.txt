They cost like damn near two dollars in cali now it fucking sucks unless you find a shop selling stales for cheap but then you gotta deal with that and why not sell wraps at like 2 for 79 cents so the tax thiefs can keep them at a dollar instead of raising it to highway robbery i buy cheap brands normally now because the tax raise
