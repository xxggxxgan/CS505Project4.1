I forgot I was following this page idk why I ever was swishers are trash
@mackofveli nah swishers lit just gotta smoke the right ones
@yur.highness_ you know what lemme correct my self I was kind cappin before, swishers just aren’t my preference I’m too used to something with a leaf like games dutches woods etc I just don’t like super flavored rellos too much.
@mackofveli ya know I feel you, I’m the opposite tho. I’ll smoke anything but swishers are my fav they’re just so yummy 🤤❤️
Mango swishers are the sweetest ones
Mango the most ass flavor
Wild rush the best
