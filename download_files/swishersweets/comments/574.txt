@rxdevin not flavoured. It’s “ illegal because it influences kids to smoke “
@thatgirlfromcheeky that’s crazy! They keep doing things over here like raising the smoking age and taxing everything to death. But damn...
@rxdevin literally we have no flavoured cigars cigarettes we had to get our blunt wraps we package to 6 grams so we can “ legally “ sell them. That’s why I’m so upset about swishers 😩😭
