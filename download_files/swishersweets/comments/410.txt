Those new swisher wraps suuuuuuck! I tried them and threw the pack away after one of each flavor.
You guys had a great opportunity to do well where Blackwood fails and your didn’t do that at all. The wrap is smaller than a wood and cut almost like a paper making it hard to roll cones. The smoke on them was way too moist and the ash was super dark and it kept going out. Super disappointed I was a swisher fan for years then started smoking backwoods and it looks like it’s staying that way
