I have been purchasing these seeets since way before i was legal. Im now 30. Recently friends and i have noticed the leafs are thinner and shorter . Theyve been cracking non stop and just busting open. Never in my life have i had this issue. I drove around my whole city and to another country just to test them out. Theyre not holding up to the older batch i had laying around. What is up with that ????
@x.dvddyxz.grrl.x.bxtch.x yes they had a horrible batch i wasted a lot of gas and money on crap
@x.dvddyxz.grrl.x.bxtch.x Thank you for the positive feedback, and thank you for being a Swisher consumer. We value your imput!
