Did you guys discontinue artic Ice??
@djstoneywinter lmk if you get another company to make them Iâ€™ve been buying artic Iâ€™ve for years, @swishersweets I donâ€™t know why you would discontinue them when I was literally buying every pack in my city for years.. it truly is sad to see a company have so little care.. you guys told me there bringing them back got my hopes up and now your saying there gone forever ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜ª I have only smoked swishers for years, but guess itâ€™s time for another brand.
@locally_known_ I feel exactly the same!!! Iâ€™ve literally searched the whole state and brought every box I can find (full boxes ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£) and itâ€™s heartbreaking I know a lot of people who like it and I myself have got a lot of people to like it and purchase it so now I feel like I just wasted their time thereâ€™s no mint/artic cigars anywhere Iâ€™ve searched high and low and itâ€™s like why stop a good thing especially when your the only one who has it!!! Itâ€™s ok other companies are going to eat this up the demand is certainly real for it
@locally_known_ I feel like they were too busy coming up with their new leaf to be in competition with backwoods that they just said forget everything else and how we feel ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
Dont ever sell these fucc ass swisher leafs, these mfs DO NOT stick
