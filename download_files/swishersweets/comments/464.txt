Nah, mango swishers are nasty
No Go ... Too perfumey
I got 4 packs,a coozie,and a tee for $1 @epicenterfest Made my day... Thanks @swishersweets
N A S T Y ‼️‼️
I wonder if the brand known as swisher sweets actually posts these swishes expecting people to smoke them or if they know that everyone is taking the tobacco out and putting "other stuff" in it
Those mango ones are fire
@backwoods_cigars are better 🤦🏾\u200d♂️
