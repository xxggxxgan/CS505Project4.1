@everyday_february_17th Thank you for the positive feedback, and thank you for being a Swisher consumer. We value your input! ☺
@swishersweets i brought  two packs yesterday ♥💯💯
@everyday_february_17th Thanks for the ❤!
This is hands down my favorite swisher. However recently the quality of the leaf has decreased and the price gone up. I find that when I buy the promotional packs (3 for $1.79) I have much fewer holes and tears in the leaf than the new packs that generally are sold for $2.19 - 2.99 where I am. I wonder if anyone else is experiencing this
