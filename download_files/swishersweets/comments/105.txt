@bigolejoint But it’s okay, because Dallas PD doesn’t give a shit lol (unless you have over 2oz)
@96javi_ oh yall chillin in Dallas then
California is the dumbest state ever I swear. Raising property tax to drive out all the rich people, make it to where Uber and Lyft can’t operate in state, and now banning flavored tobacco. They really are on some shit rn

A lot of cities in CA have already banned them. I have to go a few towns over for that grape 😫

Smh I can’t believe this crap.
Hey do you have coupons for a full box of sweets? All the small stores in Chicago are TAXING, talking about 2.29 for a pair of blunts. Then they want to use a sharpie to scribble off the 99¢.... tweaking
