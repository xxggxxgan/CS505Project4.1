🔥🔥🔥 if only I could find them around where I live! Higher demand than product
Omg...I’m in love 💕
Can you explain why in California Green Swishers cost $1.49 when White Grape cost $1.29 also why are Swishers 99cent in Las Vegas. I don’t understand how the price varies. PLEASE EXPLAIN
@chargeavalanche what I’m talking about is the price printed on the actual Swisher. Some flavors are 1.49 and others 1.29 then travel to Vegas and the printed price on a Swisher is 99cents. State taxes has nothing to do with what’s printed on the package.
@king.roosevelt California has both price points for tax purposes ☺
