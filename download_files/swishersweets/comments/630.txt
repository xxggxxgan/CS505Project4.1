Pesticide fail !
Where is the report of pesticides? I cannot find anyone reporting that.
@glassyboi so he took one item and tested it after it could have been contaminated. That’s not really a good sample size.
@glassyboi I would just want to see multiple flavor packs from a bunch of different shops tested to get a better sample. For all we know that one pack could’ve been contaminated after it was sold by swisher. To rule that out you get multiple sources.
